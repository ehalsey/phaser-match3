let's create a match 3 Phaser 3 game.  Every type of move should be tested before adding additional
  capabilities.  We are going to do this step by step.  First setting up all the basics for a game.  Should   
  have main screen, level scene, end level scene and end game scene. We should use the latest and greatest    
  Phaser capabilities and use 3rd party Phaser addins where it makes sense 

  The goal of the game is to keep players engaged and wanting to play.

  Their should be a meta scoring feature.  Coins are the top level and scaled leveled coins based on level difficulty and points scored during the level.  Maybe 30, 50 & 70 coins based on the level score.

  We want to start the dev incrementally unless you suggest otherwise.

  I think the first step would be to create a 3x4 board where we have a test board where the initial board is setup for a 1x3 match.  I want to validate this step via automated tests before adding additional features, etc.
